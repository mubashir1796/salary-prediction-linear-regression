\# Predicting Salary Using Linear Regression



\## Overview

This project builds a linear regression model to predict employee salaries based on years of work experience. The objective is to demonstrate how historical data can support fair and data-driven compensation decisions in a corporate environment.



The final model achieves an R² score of 0.90, indicating strong predictive performance. Model assumptions are validated using residual analysis, and stability is confirmed through cross-validation.



\## Problem Statement

During periods of economic slowdown and inflation, organizations must carefully manage hiring costs while maintaining employee motivation. Determining appropriate salary levels for future hires is a common challenge for finance and HR teams.
